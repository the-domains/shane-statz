I currently offer lessons in saxophone, clarinet, flute, and improvisation from [Anacrusis Music][0] in southwest Calgary, (403)301-4442

I work with students of all levels, from elementary-school beginners to advanced high-school students auditioning for university music programs. My teaching focuses on proper sound production, technique, and helping each student find their individual musical voice. I shape instruction to fit the needs, ability, and goals of individual students. Improvisation in various styles (jazz, rock, blues, latin, etc.), theory, composition, ear training and more are woven into weekly curriculum for each student.
